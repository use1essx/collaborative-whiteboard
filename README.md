## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Canvas**: HTML5 Canvas API
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Real-time Sync**: Polling-based sync (1 second intervals)

## üìù Notes

- **In-Memory Storage**: The current implementation stores drawing data in memory on the server. This means:
  - Drawings will be lost when the server restarts
  - Not suitable for very long drawing sessions with many strokes
  
- **For Production**: Consider upgrading to a persistent database like:
  - **Redis** for fast real-time data
  - **MongoDB** for document storage
  - **PostgreSQL** for relational data
  - **Liveblocks** or **Pusher** for professional real-time features

## üîß Customization

### Change Sync Interval
Edit `components/Whiteboard.tsx`, line 50:
```typescript
}, 1000) // Change from 1000ms (1 second) to your preferred interval
```

### Add More Colors
Edit `components/Toolbar.tsx`, add colors to the `colors` array:
```typescript
const colors = [
  '#000000',
  '#FF0000',
  // Add more hex colors here
]
```

### Adjust Maximum Strokes
Edit `app/api/canvas/route.ts`, change `MAX_STROKES`:
```typescript
const MAX_STROKES = 10000 // Increase or decrease as needed
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Drawings not syncing?** Check your internet connection and make sure the API route is working
- **Canvas not showing?** Try refreshing the page
- **Build errors?** Make sure you're using Node.js 18 or higher
